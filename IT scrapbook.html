    <p class="experience">This is the most precious 4 year you can get to build your career, your personality, exhibit your creativity and to enjoy the time with friends. Don't be shy or afraid of anything, just embrace it and enjoy it. And sometime you don't need to react on something or someone, that affect you. JUST IGNORE. Your life wouldn't stop for them. Always focus on your career, do something productive and try hard to chase your dream. Best of luck.</p>

    <p class="experience">A college education shows a man how little other people know. Colleges do not make fools; they only develop them. Hard work never killed anyone, but I don't want to be the first. College is like a fountain of knowledge – and the students are there to drink. The simplest college boy is now familiar with truths for which Archimedes would have given his life. Experience college life and enjoy. You are the pawns in the first year; you are ministers in the second year; You become the king of campus in the final year. 80% of the final exam will be based on the one lecture you missed and the one book you didn't read. </p>

    <p class="experience">Everything say about my experience about my college is not enough. When we entered in college campus in  very fast time, we were like an discrete stones roaming into space. But after time passed on, we became like an solar system. We enjoyed together, laughed together, cried together and faced every situation together. From freshers welcome party to get-together, different festivals, fests to all the lab classes, every semester tests, grand viva, practical lab exams, going to movies after bunking classes, spending hours inside college canteen,I remember each and every day. From new relationships to heart breaks, from getting new friends to losing old ones, everything was going very smoothly. But the Corona situation came suddenly out of nowhere, we couldn't attend the college for almost like 1.5 years. That time period we lost is never comming back and we got graduated almost from home. This was a great loss of our life. During this writing, may be a drop of water came out of my eyes but no one's going to see that and no one is going to remember after five years from now for sure. That's how my college life passed by before even understanding that it is passed completely.</p>

    <p class="experience">We are the unluckiest generation in terms of college life. Our college life ended up like the end of a beautiful dream. We were like a family. We were spectator of thousands of smile, crying, starting of new and hearthbreaks and what not. But I'm lucky that I have got some persons with unbreakable bonds. We realized a thing that we never give importance to a time or person until they become memories. It was our 2nd home. Thnaks to all the teachers and persons who were beside us throughout the journey. </p>
